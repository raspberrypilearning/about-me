## Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to write a Python program telling people all about themselves. They will create ASCII art (images from text) and perform calculations based on user input.

## Online Resources

__This project uses Python 3.__ We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write Python online. This project contains the following Trinkets:

+ [New (blank) Python Trinket -- jumpto.cc/python-new](http://jumpto.cc/python-new)

There is also a trinket containing the completed project:

+ [‘About Me’ Finished -- trinket.io/python/a1f663ae0d](https://trinket.io/python/a1f663ae0d)

## Offline Resources
This project can be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/python-working-offline/) if preferred. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

+ about/about.py

You can also find a completed version of this project in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

+ about-finished/about.py

(All of the resources above are also downloadable as project and volunteer `.zip` files.)

## Learning Objectives
+ Sequencing;
+ Variables;
+ Converting between text and integer (whole number) data types.

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)

## Challenges
+ What's on your mind? - writing a first Python program using the `print` statement.
+ "About yourself" - printing text and ASCII art to the screen. __Remember that the code children write in Trinket is public. Remind them not to share any personal information like their full name or address.__
+ "Your age in dog years" - performing a calculation based on the user's input.
