## Challenge: About yourself
Write a Python program to tell others about yourself, by using text and ASCII art. You can create images of your hobbies, friends… or anything you like!

__Remember that the code you write in Trinket is public. Don't share any personal information like your full name or address!__

Here’s an example:

## Step 3: The Year 2025

You can also do calculations and print numbers. Let's find out how old you'll be in the year 2025.



+ To calculate how old you'll be in the year 2025, you need to subtract the year you were born from 2025.

    Add this code to your program:

    Notice that you don't need to put quotes around numbers.

    (You'll need to change the number `2006` if you were born in a different year.)

+ Click 'run' and your program should print your age in the year 2025.

+ You could improve your program by using `input()` to ask the user their age and store it in a __variable__ called `born`.

+ Run your program and then enter the year you were born. Did you get another error messgae?

    That's because anything typed into your program is __text__, and it needs to be converted to a __number__.

    You can use `int()` to convert the text to an __integer__ ('integer' means 'whole number').

+ You can also create another variable to store your calculation, and print that instead.

+ Finally, you can make your program easier to understand by adding a helpful message.
