## Saying hello

Let's start by writing some text.

Open the [About me starter](https://editor.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/about-me-starter){:target="_blank"} project. The code editor will open in another browser tab.

Type the following into the window that appears:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 1
line_highlights: 1
---
print('Hello!')
--- /code ---

--- /task ---

Click **Run**, and you should see that the `print()` command prints everything between the quote marks `''`.

If you've made a mistake, you'll get an error message telling you what went wrong instead!

Try it! Delete the end quote `'` or the closing bracket `)` (or both) and see what happens.

Add the quote or bracket back in, and click **Run** to make sure your project works again.
