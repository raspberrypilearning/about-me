## Saying hello

Let's start by writing some text.

+ Open the blank Python template Trinket: <a href="http://jumpto.cc/python-new" target="_blank">jumpto.cc/python-new</a>.

+ Type the following into the window that appears:

    The line `#!/bin/python3` just tells Trinket that we're using Python 3 (the latest version).

+ Press 'run', and you should see that the `print()` command prints everything between the quote marks `''`.

+ If you make a mistake, you'll get an error message instead - telling you what went wrong!

    Try it! Delete the end quote `'` or the closing bracket `)` (or both) and see what happens.

+ Replace the quote or bracket and click 'run' to make sure your project works again.
