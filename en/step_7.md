## Challenge: your age in dog years
Write a program to ask the user their age, and then tell them their age in dog years! 

You can calculate a personâ€™s age in dog years by multiplying their age by 7.

```
What is your age? 9
If you were a dog, you'd be 63 !!

In programming, the symbol for __multiplication__ is the `*` character, which you can usually type by pressing <kbd>Shift + 8</kbd> on the keyboard.
