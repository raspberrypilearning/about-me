    Notice that you don't need to put quotes around numbers. (You'll need to change the number `2006` if you were born in a different year.)

+ Click **Run**, and your program should print your age in the year 2025.

+ You could improve your program by using `input()` to ask the user their age and store it in a **variable** called `born`.

+ Run your program and then enter the year you were born. Did you get another error messgae?
    
    That's because anything typed into your program is **text**, and it needs to be converted to a **number**.
    
    You can use `int()` to convert the text to an **integer**. An integer is a whole number.
