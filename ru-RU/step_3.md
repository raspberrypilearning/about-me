## Saying hello

Let's start by writing some text.

+ Open the blank Python template trinket: <a href="http://jumpto.cc/python-new" target="_blank">jumpto.cc/python-new</a>.

+ Type the following into the window that appears:

    The line `#!/bin/python3` just tells Trinket that we're using Python 3 (the latest version).

+ Click **Run**, and you should see that the `print()` command prints everything between the quote marks `''`.

If you've made a mistake, you'll get an error message telling you what went wrong instead!

+ Try it! Delete the end quote `'` or the closing bracket `)` (or both) and see what happens.

+ Add the quote or bracket back in, and click **Run** to make sure your project works again.

**You don't need a Trinket account to save your projects!**

If you don't have a Trinket account, click the down arrow and then click **Link**. This will give you a link that you can save and come back to later. You'll need to do this every time you make changes, as the link will change!

If you have a Trinket account, you can click **Remix** to save your own copy of the trinket.
